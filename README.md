# Clothing Ecommerce Website
Front-end udemy course project of an ecommerce website with React. It allows the user to register, 
login/logout, and to put into the chart items and/or purchase them. The back-end side, which adds the user authorization
system, is added through Firebase. The testing payment system sits on top of Stripe, an online payment processing API. 
The front-end uses react, redux, and some extra libraries such as reselect for adding memoization or redux-persist for storing
data in locale storage.
